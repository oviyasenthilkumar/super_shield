            Special attention should be given to the use of waterstops at
            movement joints. Movement joints are necessary because of movement
            in the structure as a result of settlement, traffic loads,
            shrinkage, or other causes. In addition to the function of the
            waterstops to act as a waterproofing seal in the joint, the
            waterstop should allow the sections to move independently of each
            other â€“ without restriction and free from tension.
