            EPOFIX is ideal for bonding elastic bands and reinforcing
            load-bearing elements like beams and columns by adhering steel
            plates, carbon fiber tapes, and similar materials to concrete. It is
            also suitable for reconstructing joints in concrete pavements and
            provides rigid structural bonding for prefabricated elements and
            artifacts made from materials such as concrete, steel, glass, wood,
            marble, bricks, and stones. Additionally, it excels in anchoring,
            bonding, and fastening connectors, tie rods, and other components in
            various construction projects.
